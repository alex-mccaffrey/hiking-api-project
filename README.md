# Hiking API Capstone

##Live link
Check out a live working version of my web app [here](https://amccaff20.github.io/hiking-api-capstone/)

##Summary
I created Tectonic MVMT to provide a clean and simple way for users to quickly gather hiking trails options in their area. There are some basic filters that allow the user to declare a maximum number of results, the miniumum length of the hike, and how to sort the hikes. In addition to this, current and future weather conditions are provided so the user can plan accordingly. The final feature is the map, where users can click on the coordinates for a certain trail and get a precise marker on the map for reference.
